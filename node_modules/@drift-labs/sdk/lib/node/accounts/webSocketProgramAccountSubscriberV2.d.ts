/**
 * WebSocketProgramAccountsSubscriberV2
 *
 * High-level overview
 * - WebSocket-first subscriber for Solana program accounts that also layers in
 *   targeted polling to detect missed updates reliably.
 * - Emits decoded account updates via the provided `onChange` callback.
 * - Designed to focus extra work on the specific accounts the consumer cares
 *   about ("monitored accounts") while keeping baseline WS behavior for the
 *   full program subscription.
 *
 * Why polling if this is a WebSocket subscriber?
 * - WS infra can stall, drop, or reorder notifications under network stress or
 *   provider hiccups. When that happens, critical account changes can be missed.
 * - To mitigate this, the class accepts a set of accounts (provided via constructor) to monitor
 *   and uses light polling to verify whether a WS change was missed.
 * - If polling detects a newer slot with different data than the last seen
 *   buffer, a centralized resubscription is triggered to restore a clean stream.
 *
 * Initial fetch (on subscribe)
 * - On `subscribe()`, we first perform a single batched fetch of all monitored
 *   accounts ("initial monitor fetch").
 * - Purpose: seed the internal `bufferAndSlotMap` and emit the latest state so
 *   consumers have up-to-date data immediately, even before WS events arrive.
 * - This step does not decide resubscription; it only establishes ground truth.
 *
 * Continuous polling (only for monitored accounts)
 * - After seeding, each monitored account is put into a monitoring cycle:
 *   1) If no WS notification for an account is observed for `pollingIntervalMs`,
 *      we enqueue it for a batched fetch (buffered for a short window).
 *   2) Once an account enters the "currently polling" set, a shared batch poll
 *      runs every `pollingIntervalMs` across all such accounts.
 *   3) If WS notifications resume for an account, that account is removed from
 *      the polling set and returns to passive monitoring.
 * - Polling compares the newly fetched buffer with the last stored buffer at a
 *   later slot. A difference indicates a missed update; we schedule a single
 *   resubscription (coalesced across accounts) to re-sync.
 *
 * Accounts the consumer cares about
 * - Provide accounts up-front via the constructor `accountsToMonitor`, or add
 *   them dynamically with `addAccountToMonitor()` and remove with
 *   `removeAccountFromMonitor()`.
 * - Only these accounts incur additional polling safeguards; other accounts are
 *   still processed from the WS stream normally.
 *
 * Resubscription strategy
 * - Missed updates from any monitored account are coalesced and trigger a single
 *   resubscription after a short delay. This avoids rapid churn.
 * - If `resubOpts.resubTimeoutMs` is set, an inactivity timer also performs a
 *   batch check of monitored accounts. If a missed update is found, the same
 *   centralized resubscription flow is used.
 *
 * Tuning knobs
 * - `setPollingInterval(ms)`: adjust how often monitoring/polling runs
 *   (default 30s). Shorter = faster detection, higher RPC load.
 * - Debounced immediate poll (~100ms): batches accounts added to polling right after inactivity.
 * - Batch size for `getMultipleAccounts` is limited to 100, requests are chunked
 *   and processed concurrently.
